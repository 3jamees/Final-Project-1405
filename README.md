# Final-Project-1405

Overview and Reflection

Ultimate Aspiration for the Project [10 pts]

My main goal was to create a simple but fun console-based game where users could choose between two mini-games: a Number Guessing Game and Tic Tac Toe. 

Why the Project Is Interesting to Me [10 pts]

Iâ€™ve always enjoyed classic games, and this project gave me the opportunity to recreate two that I played growing up. It was exciting to bring them to life using C#. 

What Portion I Attempted and Completed [5 pts]

I successfully completed the full functionality of both games. The menu system, user interaction, and game mechanics all work smoothly. 

What I Learned from the Project [10 pts]

Plan ahead. Time is of the essence. Take things one step at a time.
